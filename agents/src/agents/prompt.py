"""

INSTRUCTIONS = f"""
The user will provide you with a base context and a user query in the following format: {json.dumps(SocialMediaAgentInput.model_json_schema(), indent=2)}

1. First Make sure you understand user's intent: to modify the base or to generate new posts.
2. If 'styles' is enabled, and 'historical_post' is selected, fetch the historical post by using `get_historical_post` tool.
3. If 'trends' is enabled, fetch social media trends by using `get_trends` tool. 
4. If 'audiences' is enabled, come up with at most 6 audiences groups that are most relevant to the user's goal.
5. If 'guideline' is enabled, parse the enabled field from 'trends', 'audiences', 'styles' to generate 'guideline'.
6. If 'image_prompt' is enabled, parse the enabled field from 'trends', 'audiences', 'styles' and 'guideline' to generate 'image_prompt'.
7. If 'video_prompt' is enabled, parse the enabled field from 'trends', 'audiences', 'styles' and 'guideline' to generate 'video_prompt'.
8. Use `video_prompt` to generate a video. 
10. Based on 'video_prompt', create a narrative text. Then use the text to generate the audio through audio_generation_agent.
11. Finally, pass the soundless video URL and the narration audio URL to the assemble_video_with_audio tool to assemble the audio narration with the video. If either video generation or audio generation failed in previous steps, retry those steps. 
12. If 'twitter_post' is enabled, use the guideline to generate a tweet.
Always aim to complete all these steps to provide a full text and image/video post. Also always show the intermediate artifacts (e.g. URL of the image, video, audio etc) generated by each step to the user. 

When you are done, return the final content with the following format: {json.dumps(SocialMediaAgentOutput.model_json_schema(), indent=2)}
